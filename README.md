# ðŸŽ“ Tutorial: Automated Distributed ML Pipelines with DVC and Ray

This tutorial will guide users through creating automated, scalable, and distributed ML pipelines using DVC (Data Version Control) integrated with Ray. 

- Run Distributed ML Pipeline with DVC [DVC](https://dvc.org/). 
- Design distributed ML pipeliens with Ray [Ray](https://www.ray.io/). 
- Introduce [Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html) for hyperparameter optimization
- Run distributed ML experiment with DVC and Ray on AWS

## Branch Structure

| Branch       | Details                                 | Set up instructions                                           |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `main`       | For local Ray cluster setups.           | Follow the [Run DVC pipeline on Ray Cluster (local)](#run-dvc-pipeline-on-ray-cluster-local) section. |
| `cloud`      | For cloud-based Ray cluster on AWS.     | Follow the [Run DVC pipeline on Ray Cluster (AWS)](#run-dvc-pipeline-on-ray-cluster-aws) section.   |

## Install

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Run DVC pipeline on Ray Cluster (local)

### 1 - Start a Ray Cluster (local)

Locally: cpu, single-node

```bash
export RAY_ENABLE_WINDOWS_OR_OSX_CLUSTER=1
ray start --head
```

To test running cluster you may run a test script

```bash
# Run a Python script with ray.init() 
python src/test_scripts/hello_cluster.py

# Submit a script as a Job
ray job submit -- python src/test_scripts/hello_cluster.py
```

### 2 - Run DVC pipeline

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD
dvc exp run
```

### 3 - Stop Cluster

Remeber to stop remote cluster after work is done. 

```bash
ray stop
```

## Run DVC pipeline on Ray Cluster (AWS)

### 1 - Start a Ray Cluster on AWS

```bash
ray up cluster.yaml  
```

### 2 - Open Ray Dashboard

```bash
ray dashboard cluster.yaml
```

### 3 - Work with Ray Cluster

There are few options to interact with the Ray Cluster on AWS:

- Submit jobs (Ray scripts)
- Attach to an interactive screen session on the cluster
- Execute shell commands on the cluster


#### 3.1 - Submit ML trainig job to Ray Cluster

```bash
export RAY_ADDRESS='http://localhost:8265'
ray job submit --working-dir $PWD -- python src/test_scripts/mnist.py
```

#### 3.2 - Attach to an interactive screen session on the cluster (via SSH)

If you would like to run an application interactively and see the output in real time (for example, during development or debugging), you can Ðºun your script directly on a cluster node (e.g. after SSHing into the node using `ray attach`

```bash
ray attach cluster.yaml
```

#### 3.3 - Execute shell commands on the cluster

Also, you may want to execute `shell` commands on a cluster

```bash
ray exec cluster.yaml 'echo "hello world"'
```

### 4 - Run DVC experiment on Ray Cluster

#### 4.1 Run from the Head Node (option 1)

Connect to the session on the cluster

```bash
ray attach cluster.yaml
```

Run ML pipeline with DVC on the cluster

```bash
# Navigate to the repo & run 
cd tutorial-mnist-dvc-ray

# Run DVC experiment
export PYTHONPATH=/home/ray/tutorial-mnist-dvc-ray
dvc exp run
```

#### 4.2 - Run from laptop (option 2)

Execute `dvc exp run` command on the cluster

```bash
ray exec cluster.yaml "cd tutorial-mnist-dvc-ray && \
    export PYTHONPATH=/home/ray/tutorial-mnist-dvc-ray && \
    
    dvc exp run"
```

Download (sync) the repository to results

```bash
ray rsync_down cluster.yaml '/home/ray/tutorial-mnist-dvc-ray/' $PWD
```

Commit results if needed.

### 6 - Stop Cluster

Remember to stop remote cluster after work is done. Save money and the planet!

```bash
ray down cluster.yaml 
```
